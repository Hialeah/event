## Forking Repository

A fork is a copy of a repository. Forking a repository allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Creating your new branch

A [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/) is a parallel version of the main line of development in the repository, or the default branch \(usually master\). Use branches to:

* Develop features
* Fix bugs
* Safely experiment with new ideas

## Adding your code to the repository

Within the new forked repository and the new branch you can feel free to add, edit, and enjoy adding your code and stuff.

You dont need picture for that. 😒

I highly recommend to use [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to work on you repository locally.

## Creating your Pull Request

Create a pull request to propose and collaborate on changes to a repository. These changes are proposed in a branch, which ensures that the master branch only contains finished and approved work.

* Click on the **New Pull Request** button to create a Pull Request.

## Merging to `master` branch

Read about [Understanding GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/).

There's only one rule: anything in the master branch is always deployable, so **Master Branch** is what the actual project is.

This is how will looks like after a brach is merged:
