# Adding Code

## Adding your code to the repository

Within the new forked repository and the new branch you can feel free to add, edit, and enjoy adding your code and stuff.

You dont need picture for that. ðŸ˜’

I highly recommend to use [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to work on you repository locally.
