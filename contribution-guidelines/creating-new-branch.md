# Creating New Branch

## Creating your new branch

A [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/about-branches/) is a parallel version of the main line of development in the repository, or the default branch \(usually master\). Use branches to:

* Develop features
* Fix bugs
* Safely experiment with new ideas
